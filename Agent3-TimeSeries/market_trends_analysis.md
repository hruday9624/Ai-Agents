# Stock Market Trend Analysis: AAPL, MSFT, GOOG (2023-01-01 to 2023-10-27)

This report analyzes the stock market trends of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG) from January 1st, 2023, to October 27th, 2023, using daily data from Yahoo Finance.  The analysis includes trend identification, anomaly detection (using a simple IQR method for outlier removal), and visualizations to provide actionable insights for forecasting.

**Data Source:** Yahoo Finance

**Data Preprocessing:**

* Data was fetched using the `yfinance` library.
* Missing values were handled by replacing them with the mean of each respective column.
* Outliers were removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.  This is a simple method and more sophisticated techniques could be employed for a more robust analysis.
* Data was saved to a CSV file for reproducibility.


**Trend Analysis:**

The following visualizations show the closing prices for each stock over the specified period.  Further analysis would involve calculating moving averages, identifying support and resistance levels, and applying other technical indicators to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the trends.

**(Insert Plots Here - See Python Script for Generation)**

* **AAPL:**  [Describe the visual trend observed in the AAPL plot.  e.g.,  "AAPL shows an overall upward trend with some periods of consolidation and minor corrections."]
* **MSFT:** [Describe the visual trend observed in the MSFT plot. e.g., "MSFT exhibits a similar upward trend to AAPL, but with potentially less volatility."]
* **GOOG:** [Describe the visual trend observed in the GOOG plot. e.g., "GOOG demonstrates a more volatile pattern compared to AAPL and MSFT, with periods of significant price swings."]


**Anomaly Detection:**

The IQR method was used to identify and remove outliers. While effective for simple outlier detection, more sophisticated methods might be necessary for a more nuanced understanding of market anomalies.  Further investigation into specific anomalies (e.g., large price gaps) would require additional analysis.


**Actionable Insights:**

* **Portfolio Diversification:** The differing volatility levels between the three stocks highlight the importance of portfolio diversification.  Investors may consider adjusting their holdings based on their risk tolerance.
* **Trend Following Strategies:**  The upward trends observed (if present) could be leveraged by trend-following strategies, but careful risk management is crucial.
* **Further Analysis:** More advanced technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) and fundamental analysis would provide a more robust basis for forecasting.
* **Machine Learning:**  The preprocessed data can be used to train machine learning models for more sophisticated forecasting.


**Limitations:**

* The analysis is based on historical data and past performance is not indicative of future results.
* The outlier removal method used is relatively simple. More sophisticated techniques could improve the accuracy of the analysis.
* The analysis focuses solely on closing prices and does not incorporate other relevant factors such as volume, market sentiment, or economic indicators.


**Recommendations:**

* Conduct further analysis using more sophisticated technical indicators and fundamental analysis.
* Incorporate additional data sources, such as news sentiment and economic indicators.
* Develop and test predictive models using machine learning techniques.

To execute this, save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `stock_analysis.py`),  run it, and it will generate the PNG files containing the plots in the same directory.  Remember to replace placeholders in the markdown report with your observations from the generated plots.  The CSV file with preprocessed data will also be saved.
