RAW IDEA:
{raw_idea}

Tone Guidelines:
- Bold but grounded
- Emotionally honest
- Slightly raw and unfiltered
- Storytelling-driven
- Solution-oriented
- Practical optimism

Structure:
1. Hook: Start with a question or bold statement
Make it scroll-stopping (curiosity, surprise, or bold opinion).
Example: “I almost walked away from everything last year.”
✅ Trigger: First 1–2 lines should create curiosity or emotion to get the “See more” click.

2. Personal Connection: Share relevant experience
Reflect on a personal story, struggle, or turning point.
Keep it raw and human — vulnerability boosts trust.
✅ Trigger: Use “I” and show imperfection to make it relatable.

3. Insight: Provide unique perspective
Share a truth, realization, or mental model that others may not have considered.
Challenge norms or show how your thinking evolved.
✅ Trigger: Slightly polarizing or thought-provoking ideas spark shares.

4. Value: Offer practical takeaways
Teach something — a mindset, method, tip, or checklist.
Structure it clearly (bullets, emojis, short lines).
✅ Trigger: Clear, practical value = more saves and comments.

5. Call-to-Action: End with a question or reflective thought
Ask something meaningful to invite conversation.
Be specific to boost engagement.
✅ Trigger: Thoughtful questions bring comments → LinkedIn boosts reach.

Requirements:
- Keep it 4–6 short paragraphs (mobile-first readability).
- Use emojis sparingly but smartly to guide flow or highlight key points.
- Avoid links in the post — add them in the comments if needed.
- Post Tuesday–Thursday mornings for best visibility.
- Engage in the first hour (comment back quickly).

Example Output Format:
[Attention-grabbing opening] [Personal story/experience] [Key insight] [Actionable advice] [Engaging question for audience]
